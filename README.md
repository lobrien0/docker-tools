# Sky's Docker Tools

The following are an assortment of custom made docker tools I have made.  
The idea is to make managing docker a little easier than it already is.

[Questions?](#Questions?)

### Important Note

These tools are made for my own use cases, but I will attempt to make them as adaptable as possible without going too much out of my way.

### Reqirements

As stated previously I will attempt to make the scripts adaptable, but I will likly use software that is not apart of linux by default.  
If that is the case, I will be sure to list the packages here along with a script that will install them all (assumuing your using a linux machine)  

> Everything assumes you already have Docker installed on your System!

> Packages:  
> `p7zip-full`  
> `p7zip-rar`

## Questions?

If you have questions about how some of the scripts work, please first look at my KB (assuming its working)
